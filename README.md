# Sleep-and-worth
Final project for INFO201
This project focuses on exploring the local GDP and average local sleep hours.
Insufficient sleep among students would result in a variety of health-risk behaviors and also poor academic performance.
We want to find out the most suitable time for workers to maximize their working efficiency. 
Our work may provide help to employees, as well as employers.
